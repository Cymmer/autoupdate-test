        You finally learned how to declare variables, and that takes Cody one
        step closer towards a more natural way of speaking! But when you become
        forgetful about what you did in your code, how would you be able to
        properly identify what variables to use when the need arises? Looking
        for answers, you turned to the next page of the manual again, and there
        lies the answer which states: "Robots speak without lagging out when
        they have ready-to-use information stored in variables. But how would it
        identify what data is stored in those variables? This is why proper
        variable naming is important. With clear, distinct names, the robot and
        you as the programmer would not be confused anymore as to which variable
        to use. In Python, we have to learn some{' '}
        <strong>naming conventions.</strong>"

        You can name a variable anything as long as it makes sense to you, but
        it would definitely be much better if it resembles what the data it
        holds is all about.

        <i>
          <strong>NO:</strong> a = 15, asd1 = "Cody"
          <br /> <strong>YES:</strong> age = 15, name = "Cody"

        But when naming variables in Python, there are restrictions and
        guidelines to follow in order to make the best out of it. Here are some
        that are worth mentioning:
        <br />
        <br />
        {`1) Variable names will only compose of letters, numbers, and/or a single
        symbol, underscore (_). Moreover, all names must always start with a
        recognized character (A-Z, a-z, _).`}
        <br />
        <br />
        <i>
          <strong>NO:</strong> 1num, my+name, $Dollars
          <br /> <strong>YES:</strong> num1, my_name, Dollars, _Dollars
        </i>
        <br />
        <br />
        {`2) Avoid using lengthy names for a variable. As much as possible, just
        make sure that the first three letters of its name makes sense when you
        read it so that it will be easy to remember and easy to type as well.`}
        <br />
        <br />
        <i>
          <strong>NO:</strong> this_is_a_variable, anInteger, MyAge
          <br /> <strong>YES:</strong> var_name, num, age
        </i>

            Python is case-sensitive. In this sense, an uppercase letter and a
            lowercase letter are treated as two different characters!
            <br />
            <br /> Donâ€™t believe me? Try this one to see it for yourself (take a
            good look at the name of the variables)!

        If there are rules and guidelines, then there are also different styles
        in naming variables! Feel free to use the style that best fits the data
        you will store in a variable. Here are a few common styles used:
