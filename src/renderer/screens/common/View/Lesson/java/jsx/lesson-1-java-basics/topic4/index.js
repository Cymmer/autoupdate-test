        Whether you use the <code>scanf</code> or <code>cin</code> from C/C++,
        one thing is for sure before being able to use them. They are predefined
        functions from a library readily available for you. In Java, the magic
        word is <code>import</code> and packages are imported. In this case, the{' '}
        <code>java.util</code> package where the <code>Scanner</code> is found.
        <br />
        <br />
        Packages in Java are simply a way to put together a group of related
        classes and Java has quite a number of packages for your use. They will
        be introduced as we go along this journey (not all of them, there's just
        too many!).
        <br />
        <br />
        Check the table below for an array of all the things we can get with
        Scanner!

            Values bigger than long values and double have a special place in
            Java? They are <code>BigInteger</code> and <code>BigDecimal</code>,
            respectively. Use them when you know the values you will need will
            go beyond <code>long</code> and <code>double</code>, respectively.
            And yes, <code>Scanner</code> has methods exactly for these two. And
            you guessed it again, they are <code>nextBigInteger()</code> and{' '}
            <code>nextBigDecimal()</code>.

        The text area below the code area is where you're supposed to type your
        input! Currently, there's a value in there 20. You can change it to any
        number you want. Just make sure it is an integer because in the code,
        it's looking for an integer (<code>input.nextInt()</code>). Don't be
        afraid to test it out.

        At this point, you are probably wondering what keyword <code>new</code>{' '}
        is seeing that you are new to Java. Hold your horses, we are going to
        get to that, thatâ€™s a promise (oh, this is from a different language!)
        <br />
        <br />
        Sometimes, we all crave for that ability to be able to control
        everything! Maybe we want to skip (not sessions from the training,
        unfortunately) certain lines or perhaps execute lines many times over.
        Java, of course, has control structures. And get this! One of them
        allows you to run forever!
